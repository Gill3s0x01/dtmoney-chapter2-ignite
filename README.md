## :page_with_curl: About

🚧 DT Money Me is an application created from the Ignite # 1 immersive training in Chapter 2, an application to manage your finances.

In it, the user has access to a tool that will help a lot, an app for financial management.

In this project I had as main objective to learn more about REACT JS technology and to consume an API, and to study all the documentation behind it, applying the knowledge in ReactJS so far.

**Node.js**: makes all calls to the API and customize the responses to be the way they have to be. Serves all data to the front end.

**ReactJS**: it is a web page where the user will have access to the application.
